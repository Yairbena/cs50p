# In a file called faces.py, implement a function called
# convert that accepts a str as input and returns that
# same input with any :) converted to 🙂 (otherwise known
# as a slightly smiling faces) and any :( converted to 🙁
# (otherwise known as a slighly frowning face). All other
# text should be returned unchanged.
# Then, in that same file, implement a function called
# main that prompts the user for input, calls convert on
# that input, and prints the result. You're welcome, but
# not required, to prompt the user explicitly, as by
# passing a str of your own as an argument to input. Be
# sure to call main at the bottom of your file.
